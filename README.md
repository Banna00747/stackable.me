# Stackable
https://stackable.me

A stack exchange like website for developers asking and answering programming questions.

Common features and actions:

1. Users can browse an issue, read the comments
2. Users can sign up for an account with email or social login (facebook/github)
3. Logged in users can answer, comment or vote up/down on answers
4. A search function to search all the issues in the platform
5. Tag the issues
6. Have the option to share code

My proposal for website framwork:

Node/Express for backend API, mongo for database and React on the front, as this is the stack what I am working on currently.
